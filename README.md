# OptiGlyph - AI Virtual Keyboard

OptiGlyph is an innovative AI virtual keyboard that enables you to type using just one hand, leveraging the power of OpenCV and the cvzone package. With OptiGlyph, you can use your index finger to select keys and perform quick hand gestures to input characters. This project aims to provide an accessible and efficient way of typing for individuals who may have limited mobility or prefer one-handed typing.

## Features

- **One-Handed Typing**: OptiGlyph is designed for one-handed typing, allowing users to comfortably type using their index finger and simple hand gestures.

- **OpenCV Integration**: The project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to capture and process hand movements for efficient typing.

- **cvzone Package**: OptiGlyph leverages the cvzone package, which simplifies computer vision tasks and helps in creating a user-friendly virtual keyboard.

- **Intuitive Gestures**: To type a character, you simply select the desired key by pointing with your index finger and then perform a quick joining and removal motion with your middle finger.

- **Special Keys**: The virtual keyboard includes essential keys such as a space button and a clear button to enhance the typing experience.
